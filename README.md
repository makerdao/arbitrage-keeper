The _DAI Stablecoin System_ incentivizes external agents, called _keepers_,
to automate certain operations around the Ethereum blockchain.

`arbitrage-keeper` performs arbitrage on OasisDEX, `join`, `exit`, `boom` and `bust`.

Keeper constantly looks for profitable enough arbitrage opportunities
and executes them the moment they become available. It can make profit on:
- taking orders on OasisDEX (on DAI/PETH, DAI/W-ETH and PETH/W-ETH pairs),
- calling `join` and `exit` to exchange between W-ETH and PETH,
- calling `boom` and `bust` to exchange between DAI and PETH.

Opportunities discovered by the keeper are sequences of token exchanges
executed using methods listed above. An opportunity can consist of two
or three steps, technically it could be more but practically it will never
be more than three.

Steps can be executed sequentially (each one as a separate Ethereum
transaction, checking if one has been successful before executing the next
one) or in one go. The latter method requires a `TxManager` contract deployed,
its address has to be passed as the `--tx-manager` argument. Also the `TxManager`
contract has to be owned by the account the keeper operates from.

You can find the source code of the `TxManager` here:
<https://github.com/makerdao/tx-manager>.

The base token is the token all arbitrage opportunities will start with.
Some amount of this token will be exchanged to some other token(s) and then exchanged
back to the base token, aiming to end up with more of it than we started with.
It implies that some amount of this token has to be provided to the keeper.
The higher the amount, the more profitable each arbitrage may be. Maximum
engagement in terms of base token can be set using the `--max-engagement` argument.

It is also beneficial to provide very small amounts of other tokens to the
keeper as well, mostly because of the rounding issues which may occur on
subsequent arbitrage steps. Currently the keeper operates on DAI, PETH and W-ETH.
It means that if we choose DAI as the base token, we should also give it some tiny
amounts of PETH and W-ETH. It may happen that due to rounding issues these amounts
will increase or decrease over time. Usually it is no more than 1 Wei increase
or decrease per one arbitrage opportunity.

`arbitrage-keeper` provides valuable source of information where to look for arbitrage
opportunities in the Dai system and how to exploit them. It also demonstrates how to do
atomic risk-free arbitrage using the [tx-manager](https://github.com/makerdao/tx-manager) contract.

The `arbitrage-keeper` will not work with multicollateral Dai, mainly because
`boom` and `bust` actions will not be present in it anymore. Instead of that,
surplus and bad debt will be liquidated via auctions, supported by the new
[auction-keeper](https://github.com/makerdao/auction-keeper).
